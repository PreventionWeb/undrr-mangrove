# Cascade layers

Mangrove ships its React Aria stylesheet **unlayered**, and there is currently
no layered flavour of it. This page explains why — because "just wrap it in
`@layer mangrove`" is the obvious fix, and today it would not work.

## Why Mangrove is not layered

An unlayered rule beats a layered rule, always, no matter the specificity. That
is the whole point of cascade layers: unlayered CSS sits at the top of the layer
order.

That cuts both ways, and it is the reason a layered build would not currently
help anyone:

- **It hurts you.** If you use Tailwind 4 — which puts its utilities in
  `@layer utilities` — and you load Mangrove, **your utility classes cannot
  override Mangrove**, because Mangrove is unlayered and therefore above every
  layer you declare.
- **But layering Mangrove would not fix it.** The React Aria surface is
  compiled into `style.css` and into every brand sheet
  (`style-preventionweb.css`, `style-irp.css`, `style-mcr.css`,
  `style-delta.css`, `style-all.css`) — the whole `.react-aria-*` surface,
  unlayered. Adding a layered copy on top of a brand stylesheet changes nothing:
  the unlayered copy inside the brand sheet still wins, whatever layer order you
  declare.

A layered React Aria file could therefore only help a consumer who loads **no**
Mangrove brand stylesheet at all — and a page with no Mangrove stylesheet is
barely a Mangrove consumer. That is why one is not built or shipped.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" />
<!-- .react-aria-Button { display: inline-flex }, unlayered -->
<style>
  @layer utilities {
    .u-block {
      display: block;
    }
  }
</style>
<button class="react-aria-Button u-block">…</button>
<!-- computed display: inline-flex — Mangrove wins, the utility loses -->
```

## Why a layered build is now possible

The React Aria surface is opt-in rather than compiled into every theme
stylesheet. Because `style.css` no longer carries an unlayered copy of the same
rules, a future layered build can now provide a genuinely lower-priority entry
point. Mangrove does not build that additional flavour yet; see
[React Aria architecture notes](ARIA-ARCHITECTURE-NOTES.md).

## If you need a layered build today

You can produce one yourself in a few lines; `postcss` is already a Mangrove
dependency. Parse the built CSS, hoist `@charset` / `@import` / `@namespace`
above the wrapper (they are illegal inside `@layer`), and wrap the rest in
`@layer mangrove { … }`.

Read the rest of this page first, though — the ordering rules and the toolchain
failures below apply to any layered stylesheet, yours included, and they are the
part that actually bites.

## What a consumer must do with any layered stylesheet

### 1. Declare the layer order first, before any stylesheet loads

**This is the one thing that must be right.** Layer order is set by first
appearance. Put the order statement in an inline `<style>` in `<head>`, above
every `<link>` and every bundler-injected stylesheet:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    @layer legacy, mangrove, utilities;
  </style>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your-layered.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your-utilities.css" />
</head>
```

In a bundled app, the equivalent is a stylesheet imported before all others:

```css
/* layers.css — imported first in your entry point */
@layer legacy, mangrove, utilities;
```

Get this wrong and the order silently inverts. If `@layer mangrove { … }`
appears before the order statement, `mangrove` registers as the *first* layer
and everything named after it in the statement — including `legacy` — ends up
*above* Mangrove:

```css
@layer mangrove {
  .x {
    color: rgb(1, 1, 1);
  }
}
@layer legacy, mangrove, utilities; /* too late */
@layer legacy {
  .x {
    color: rgb(2, 2, 2);
  }
}
/* computed: rgb(2,2,2) — legacy beats mangrove, which is backwards */
```

There is no warning and no console error. The page just looks wrong.

### 2. Put your unlayered legacy CSS into a layer — the one-line change

This is the trap that made Mangrove ship unlayered in the first place. Layered
Mangrove versus **unlayered** legacy CSS means legacy wins every rule, even a
low-specificity one:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-layered-mangrove.css" />
<style>
  .legacy button {
    display: grid;
  }
</style>
<!-- computed display: grid — legacy beats Mangrove -->
```

The fix is one line at each `<link>` for a legacy stylesheet you do not want
outranking Mangrove — wrap it at import time:

```css
/* in the stylesheet that loads your legacy CSS */
@import url('./legacy.css') layer(legacy);
```

Or, if that stylesheet is yours to edit, wrap its contents directly:

```css
@layer legacy {
  /* … all of your existing legacy CSS, unchanged … */
}
```

**Prefer wrapping the contents over `@import … layer()`.** See the toolchain
warnings below — `@import … layer()` is the part that breaks in build tools.

### 3. Do not double-wrap

Import an already-layered file plainly. Doing
`@import url('layered.css') layer(vendor)` nests it as `vendor.mangrove`, so
`@layer legacy, mangrove, utilities` no longer refers to it and your ordering
silently stops applying.

## What breaks if you get it wrong

| Mistake                                        | Symptom                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unlayered Mangrove + Tailwind (**today's shape**) | Utility classes have no effect on React Aria elements.                   |
| Layered stylesheet, no order statement         | Order falls back to first appearance; usually still fine, but not stated.   |
| Order statement after the first `@layer` block | Order silently inverts; legacy CSS outranks Mangrove.                       |
| Layered Mangrove + unlayered legacy CSS        | Legacy CSS wins every conflict, including single-class selectors.           |
| A layered copy loaded alongside a brand sheet  | The unlayered copy in the brand sheet wins everything. No effect.           |

## Toolchain warnings — measured, not assumed

These were tested in this repository on 2026-09-02.

### Sass preserves everything (verified)

`sass` 1.103.1 passes `@layer` blocks, bare `@layer a, b, c;` order statements
and `@import url("x.css") layer(name)` through untouched, in both expanded and
`--style=compressed` output. Sass is not a risk.

### webpack + css-loader reorders `@import … layer()` (verified, and it breaks ordering)

Compiling through this repo's own webpack stack (`css-loader` 7,
`sass-loader` 17, `mini-css-extract-plugin`, `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`),
this input:

```css
@import url('./plain.css') layer(mangrove);
@layer legacy, mangrove, utilities;
@layer mangrove {
  .a {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

produced this output:

```css
@layer mangrove{.imported{color:#639}.a{color:red}}@layer legacy, mangrove, utilities;@layer mangrove{}.c{color:#000}
```

css-loader inlined the import correctly, but **hoisted the resulting
`@layer mangrove` block above the order statement.** Loading that artifact in a
browser confirmed the consequence: a consumer's `@layer legacy` rule then beat
Mangrove, the exact inverse of the intent.

Do not rely on `@import … layer()` surviving a bundler. Wrap layer contents
directly instead.

### Drupal's CSS aggregator does not understand `@import … layer()` (researched)

Drupal core's `CssOptimizer` inlines local `@import` statements during
aggregation using a regex that has no accommodation for a trailing `layer(…)`:

```
/@import\s*(?:url\(\s*)?['"]?(?![a-z]+:)(?!\/\/)([^'"\()]+)['"]?\s*\)?\s*;/
```

An `@import url('x.css') layer(y);` does not match, so it is left in place
rather than inlined — it still works in the browser, but it is excluded from the
aggregate and costs an extra request. This is a known, still-open core issue:
[#3470829 "Support for CSS Cascade Layer import in CssOptimizer"](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3470829)
(opened Aug 2024, MR
[!9361](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/merge_requests/9361) not
merged as of Sept 2026). `@import` handling in `CssOptimizer` has a long history
of edge-case breakage generally — see
[#2936067](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2936067),
[#413296](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/413296),
[#3133572](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3133572).

**What we could not confirm:** whether Drupal aggregation preserves plain
`@layer name { … }` *blocks*. Nothing in `CssOptimizer` is `@layer`-aware and
its transformations are comment stripping, whitespace minification and `url()`
rewriting, none of which should touch an at-rule block — but we found no
drupal.org issue or test that states this either way, and we did not run a live
Drupal aggregation. If you are the first Drupal site to ship a layered
stylesheet, verify with aggregation switched on before trusting it in
production.

Note also that aggregation strips comments and rewrites relative `url()` paths.
Neither affects layering.

### Browser support (researched)

Both features are Baseline "widely available":

| Feature                 | Chrome/Edge | Firefox | Safari / iOS | Shipped     |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `@layer` block          | 99          | 97      | 15.4         | ~March 2022 |
| `@import … layer(name)` | 99          | 97      | 15.4         | ~March 2022 |

They are tracked as separate compatibility entries but shipped together in every
engine, so there is no browser-side reason to prefer one over the other. The
risk with `@import … layer()` is entirely in build tooling, above.

Browsers that predate `@layer` ignore the whole `@layer { … }` block, so an old
browser loading a layered stylesheet gets **none of its rules at all**. If you
still support pre-2022 browsers, ship unlayered CSS.

## Design tokens stay unlayered

The `aria/tokens/*.css` files are deliberately **not**
layered. They only declare custom properties, and keeping them out of a layer
means a consumer can override a token from anywhere without thinking about layer
order. Import them alongside `aria/react-aria.css` however you load it.
